Oh hello,

Just thought I'd stop in and say I've just released Interflix, a Netflix que
management app for android phones. Here is the appbrain widget if you'd like
to get it:

[InterFlix Beta for Android on AppBrain](http://www.appbrain.com/app
/interflix-beta/org.philwade.android.interflix)

If you'd just like to read a bit more about it, there is a link to the
informational wiki page in the sidebar. As a side note, I've added the sidebar
(over there on the left), and changed the styles around a little bit to be not
quite so dark. I think I like it.
