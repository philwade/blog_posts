Instead of a blog post here, this week I opted to write about bread over at my
(and Hillary's) cooking blog: [Us Versus
Dinner](http://usversusdinner.com/post/easy_bread_for_two_weeks/). If you're
into that sort of thing, or just like looking at pictures of tasty bread, give
it a look. I'll be back here next week with something more appropriately
nerdy.
