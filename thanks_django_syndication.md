I've added an rss feed to the site, since every good blog really needs a way
for people to keep track of it... I would forget more than half of the blogs
that I regularly read if not for the google reader item I see every morning on
my homepage. Of course, this isn't an rss feed rolled from scratch. The
minutiate of writing and testing your very own xml creation is not very much
fun. Xml is a necessary evil in many cases, but I try to stay on the parsing
side of things whenever possible. I have many thanks to give to the [Django
Syndication
Framework](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/syndication/).

  
The question this brings to mind is - If I'm trying to learn python through
django, how much of the code should I be writing from scratch and how much of
it should be contributed add ons? Tough question. From what I gather, a lot of
python coding is "from x import y". I watched a talk from PyCon where Steve,
who wrote [reddit](http://www.reddit.com) (twice) talked about how every time
they need something new, they use the standard python implementation until
such a time as they either need or have time to roll their own version of a
feature. For me, up to this point, included stuff seems to be a good way to
get past the stuff with annoying implementations: rss and comments so far. I'm
thinking I can revisit the stuff I want to learn more in depth once I get past
the "need to get done" stuff for the site. So far, even implementing the
included stuff has taught me a ton.
