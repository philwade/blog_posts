So I've phased back into doing some code writing in my spare time. I tend to
go back and forth between really loving to write new code and just wanting to
play Minecraft/veg out all the time. I like to think of the two activities as
a rest from each other.

  
The last round of big coding resulted in [Interflix](https://market.android.co
m/details?id=org.philwade.android.interflix), which I'm quite proud of, even
though it isn't completely finished. I'm not sure that I will get around to
finishing it, what with the official Netflix android app being released, so
perhaps I'll just release the source.

  
Anyway, my current burst of activity involves
[tgrep](www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/fjgit), a challenge I saw on reddit and
initially implemented in Python. Now I'm trying to re-implement it in C, which
is a quite fun. I've been working in programming languages with "C style"
syntax for most of my programming career, but never bothered to learn C. I
thought this was a good opportunity to do so. It is a bit more challenging
than I thought it would be.

  
Anyways, you can now follow along with my code adventures via my [bitbucket
account](https://bitbucket.org/pivotal). Right now it's just tgrep and some
[project euler](http://projecteuler.net) code, but I'll be putting anything
non-proprietary that I do up there from now on.
