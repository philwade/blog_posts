One thing I've been meaning to just bang out here is pagination.
Interestingly, I ended up writing posts more quickly than code, leaving older
posts stranded with no way to navigate to them. Even with stranded posts, I
continued meaning to write the code instead of doing it.

Anyways, nothing like a bit of insomnia to tackle something you've been
putting off. The pager is available on the bottom of pages, although I can't
be bothered to make it look pretty.
