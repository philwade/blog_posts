Work continues on the site, trying to get the CSS just how I want it, also
tweaking the code base so that things are properly seperated, i.e. low
cohesion between different elements of the code. I've been working through
various parts of the django tutorials and the book (which is on its way from
amazon) and find myself getting ahead of the tutorials quite often. This has a
lot to do with the fact that I'm used to working with the Symfony framework
for php. Working with a framework, things like separating logic and
presentation, seperating urls from actions (or views, depending on what
framework), etc are constantly hammered into your head. The django tutorial
starts you out with high cohesion and gradually works apart the various
pieces. So instead of working straight through the tutorial, I would find
myself hopping right into the documentation to look for the django
implementation of a feature I use all the time in symfony. Not the best way to
work - however, today on reddit, I stumbled accross [Top 10 tips to a new
django developer](http://blog.dpeepul.com/2009/08/31/top-10-tips-to-a-new-
django-developer/). Great set of tips, not so much for the technical aspects,
but it quickly pointed out a number of things I had been looking for.

  
Gotta go, but more on this later as well as database issues!
