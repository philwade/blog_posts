Welcome to philwade.org - my name is phil and I work as a web developer. This
site is meant to be a promotional vehicle for me as well as a place for me to
play with/practice my development skills. I work primarily with PHP and the
[Symfony Framework](http://www.symfony-project.org) at work, but its long been
my desire to learn python (and more). Everybody knows the best way to learn
something is to just haul off and build something using it, so this blog is in
the process of being built using Django. I'm going to try and spend my free
time improving and expanding the code, as well as trying to brain dump into
the blog fairly often.

  
So far, I'm enjoying coding in Django... I've only been professionally
developing for about 2 years, and I'd like to think that I've picked up a few
good habits in that time, as well as learning why some of my old habits were
bad ideastm. Working with python (as opposed to PHP) really seems to reinforce
the lessons that I've learned.

  
Ok, that's it for now... more to come hopefully.
