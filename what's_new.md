Its been a while since I wrote an update here, and this is because its been a
while since I've spent much of my leisure time hacking on anything
particularly interesting. I've had some fairly interesting problems to play
with at work, and the thing is, I really only have so much _coding_ in me
every day. When that isn't being used up with work related stuff, I find
myself itching to spend my leisure time cranking stuff out. Lately that hasn't
been the case. I know that it's in my best interest to spend time coding and
writing about coding outside of work, but my personal resolve to do that tends
to vary in the extreme. A graph of my posting frequency looks like a sine wave
with a rapid interval.

  
What have I been up to? [Pretzels.](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-
brown/homemade-soft-pretzels-recipe/index.html) If you've got the ingredients,
give it a shot. They're real awesome, and it's very satisfying to see them
come out of the oven. If there are too many, freeze those suckers. I'm still
experimenting with how to thaw them, but 300 degrees for about 7 minutes seems
to be the sweet spot.
