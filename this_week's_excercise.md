Yesterday, I realized that I hadn't started thinking about what my writing
exercise would be this week. I usually have some ideas by Tuesday, but this
week was coming up dry. I spent some time considering various short fiction
options, although I'm not sure that that's what I want this blog to be about,
or if this is even a good medium for that. So really, nothing.

  
Then, this morning, I realized that I was doing my weekly writing out of the
blue. I was writing a letter to my congressperson, and it was, as a bonus,
good practice. Congress is currently considering a bill called SOPA (Stop
Online Piracy Act), which has potential to undermine the way we use the
internet. While the legality and morality of piracy is debatable, this bill
would put in place measures that are a threat to online free speech and
innovation, two things we can ill afford to lose. You should [read about
it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act) and decide how you
feel.

  
If you decide that this bill will be a bad thing, you'll be in the company of
Google, Yahoo, and a number of other prominent internet companies, and I would
urge you to also [write your
congressperson](https://writerep.house.gov/writerep/welcome.shtml). I'm of the
opinion that if you like **the internet as it is now**, you should be opposed
to this legislation.

  
Sorry to be a bit preachy, but as someone who makes their living working
online, this sort of thing threatens me personally as well as having terrible
ramifications for status as a free society.
