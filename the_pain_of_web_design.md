I've swapped the colors around bit... the original green/yellow scheme that I
decided on really did not sit well after a month or so on my hard drive, and
really became an issue when I actually made this site live. It's fine for
something to bother me when it is just on private display, not so much when on
public.

  
Putting together the nuts and bolts of a website is a task I like. Working on
the paint job, however, is a painful, irritating process.

  
Naturally, I sought an easier way through the old standby, google. I was not
disappointed. [Color Wizard](http://www.colorsontheweb.com/colorwizard.asp) is
a tool that lets you input a base color and provides you with a whole set of
colors that complement it based on real color theory. Utterly perfect for me,
because minute shade tweaking is not a lot of fun, and because I seem to have
a great deal of trouble perceiving what colors actually go together and which
colors look like an unspeakable horror.

  
I'd like to say that was the end of it. I inputted my base color, and machine,
logic, and science triumph over the evils of aesthetic design and voila! New
color scheme. (I love it when that happens!)

  
Sadly, not the case. I switched around the colors, but still had to go through
about 20 iterations of turning the screen towards my girlfriend and saying
"How about this?" before we reached a consensus on what didn't look awful.
Thanks for the kickstart "machine, logic and science", but the point still has
to go to aesthetic. In the future, this task may just need to be completely
outsourced to the girlfriend.
